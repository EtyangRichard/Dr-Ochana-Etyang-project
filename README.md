BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Video content creation means the procedure of planning, establishing and dissemination of video content for the purpose of achieving marketing and business goals. Some of the video content created by big companies include  explainer videos, Customer testimonial videos, products tutorials and demos, and live streams and webiners. Creation of video content by big companies has been on the rise for the past decades due to the changing dynamics in the market. Some of the changes include: Increase in population, change in technology, increased competition from other companies, products demand and supply. Microsoft is one big company established in 1975 to develop softwares and hard wares which are in use to date. However, vast competition has been mounted to them with other companies such as Oracle, Apple, Google, Cisco, IBM and many others. The other companies have been competing Microsoft through video content creation to market their brands and improve their status quo. They aim to begin the process by creating a new movie studio.

There is a wide array of films which are doing well and encapsulated in different sets of data which needs proper analysis in order to take appropriate steps by the company.

My main objective is to find out the perfomance of the different films and assist develop actionable insights for appropriate decision making by the Microsoft company.
In the project I have followed the following steps which include business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, data analysis and visualization
